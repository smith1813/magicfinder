# MagicFinder

Small MTG card search engine using scryfall api. A week long project for learning React.js and tailwindCSS 

I will set this project on hold since i'm learning new frameworks at the moment.
## TO FIX:
- Size disparity between single faced card and double faced card on print (flex max height issues probably)
## Proposed Work

- Implement lazy loading on card images, it looks laggy on long results
- Implement pagination for more than 50 results
- Spell correction for known catalog cards (The API does not support this feature, will have to do it by hand)
- Make "footer" component.
