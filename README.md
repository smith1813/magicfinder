# MTG react demo

MTG card selector from scryfall api, still adding features. Still learning how to use react

## TO FIX:
- Size disparity between single faced card and double faced card on print (flex max height issues probably)
- Size of legalties works shabby, fix it
## Proposed Work

- Implement lazy loading on card images, it looks laggy on long results
- Implement pagination for more than 50 results
- Spell correction for known catalog cards (The API does not support this feature, will have to do it by hand)
- Make "footer" component.
